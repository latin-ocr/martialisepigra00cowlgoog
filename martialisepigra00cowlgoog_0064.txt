Ep. xxxn.
Tur bee indeed. nd through the mber firm, . ·
&ems buried in rhe inice, ehieh rm hir own.
So honour'd vm, a life in labore spent:
Such might he wissr to here his monument.

Ep. xxxvn.
Tere thousand ponde in bank, and Soatra-ser fundsz' “
Ι Twenty in India stede, and India bonde ·
,Five thousand more heve you in three per center

A thousand are your Kent arrd Effex tentae
These from Barbadoee areos late the same. ‚

All thie [know. ar well ar my own name.
The daily tale ie grown extremely dell: ’

1 cannot hear it gratie on my four.
For every time give rue e guinea stiln
Repeat it then as often as yon will.

·’ Ep.xxx1.x.
Wrovenr, grav'd‚ embost, of old and modern dete,

ln the best teste, how great your stock of plato!
Here Phidias, there Praxiteles doth stand:

Here the sole piece, that'e left, of Mentor’s hand,-

This cistem did a Jemingham invent:

'That bowl and, cup were both defign‘d by Kent.

‘Morgst an the things, where art and fancy join,' . '

1 wonder you no filver hare in eoin.
