Bookl. »Szuucu Eurorum . ’ry “

Iu whisperu smile, or wear a dismal fece:
Iu whispers stete, or else laurent, the cese:
Now hum a tuue, judicious now appear, Ἰ

Now hold your tongue, now hollow, in the ear.
Ie thiu a secret too? Your acceut raiser
Ι 'We love the king, whom you in whisperu praiseq'

·- Ep. C.

wazu sume time since you had uot clear · ¹
Ι Above three hundred pouudsuyear,

Y'ou lived so well, your bounty such,

Your friends ull wissr'd you twice ae much:

Hoeven wito our wissueo soon eompliedr

Iofixruouthr four reletiouu died. ,

But you, so fur r'rour having more,

Seeru robb'd of what you hed before:
Agreeter miser every day, ’
Live iu a 'cursed stawiug weyt

Scuree entertain ue ouee a yearr

Aud then not worth a grout the cheer:
Seven old companium, meu of seuse, '
scarce eost you uow ιιι many peuce.

Whrtuunwe wissryou ouourpert?
What wissu can equal your desert?

Thousauds oyeer may heaven grant!
Thou you will stowe, end uie for want! .
