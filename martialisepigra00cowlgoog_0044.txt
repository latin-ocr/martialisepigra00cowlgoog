Ep. XLIV. Γ
ΤΗ-ι ΐεηνεηετ, who of late so rich is grown,

Whom wo have long so intimately known, ι’
Saw my coat laced, my boy in livery wait,
And on my fide-board asmall pioco of place ε

He thence concludes, l‘m' now extravagants
And feuring I may his “affistance want, ’

He mumblos to himself, that Ι may hoar ε .

ι My God! what will become of me thiuyear! ’ 1
¹ ⁸· Seven thousand pounds to Gripe, to Shylock soor ⁸. ¹

“ ⁴ l owe ς and to my broker as much-more!

“ And not one farthing hy me! nor can get!

How great, old friend, is your ehange-alley wito

To ask and be denied is hard, all know ι

Beforel ask, is most extremely so.

mmm.
Wmo, and good fa're, and my own person nice,
Backgammon-tobles, and a pair of dice,
Books very few, but those all chosen right,
„ one only friend, and him not unpolite‚ s
A„ man and maid, both honest, free from crime, ’
Both ne‘at and handy, aod in age’s prime,
“ Grant mein any corneres the laod: Ι
‘lours be, the towns or yours the world’s command.
