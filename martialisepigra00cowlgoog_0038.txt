Ἐγ. XI.
Su you the cloud on yondqr ιιιοιιιίἰ face? ·
Walking the Man, the last who quito the place: ·
In tragic hlence, and in dumph profound,
- His nofe almost drawa furrows on the ground:
His wig· he twitchea, and he mnes the air.
»Is he for friend οι brother in despaith
’Τίι ιιοίιιςίι thing. Two sons with him do dwell‘z
They both are promifing, they both are well: .
So his good wife, for whom we all do pray:

' Safe are his bags3 nor servants run awayz

Duly accounts his stewahd sor hi· tenu ἐ

And by his bailist’s care hh crepe augment.

ἴ Say, from what cause can such ιίὰίἂίοιι come!

Is there not cause? γε gode! hesuputhome. .

. - Ep. XVI.
meov! ιι ιίἰ lus 1llness ιι hm bed, ,
Made up of chintz and flues prohibited: .
Nearitan Ιιιὰιιι {creon and workdsettee
· hnhame his sever toa high degree
When he ιι νωίἰ, these fopperies are not seen:

ἵ They make him fick, and gwe ιιι too the spleen.

Dismiss his ὰοᾶοιι· and apply my spell-
, Let him changebeds with me, andhe'llhewell.
